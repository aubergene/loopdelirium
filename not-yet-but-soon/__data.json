Typically, when using text based generative AI, prompting is considered an art form in itself, with the specific sequence of words constructing exactly what the artist intends. This work reverses this dynamic, with ambiguous prompts open to a wide range of interpretation.\n\nThe AI model provides a non-human perspective on human data and experience – a diffracted view, like a prism that splits light into reconfigurations. This diffracted view reveals the content, subjectivity and bias inherent in the creation of the specific text and audio models.\n\nPrism 2.0 was created six months after the first film, and serves as a document of the acceleration of this technology’s development. The intention is to continue making updates to this film as a homage to the Up series of documentaries directed by Michael Apted and Paul Almond, but in this case document the changing “face” of AI.",{"id":17,"title":18,"date":19,"artist":20,"medium":21,"dimensions":22,"description":23},"3","Untitled (Mobile)","2024","Julian Bramley Burgess","Acrylic, thread","60cm x 110cm","The piece reflects exploration of kinetic and constructive art, cele-The piece reflects exploration of kinetic and constructive art, celebrating the elegance of structure in motion and echoing constructivist ideals of spatial presence and balance.",{"id":25,"title":26,"date":27,"artist":28,"medium":29,"dimensions":30,"description":31},"4","Light Sleeper ","2023","Owen Planchart","Bed, metronome, Esp32 micro-controller, microphone, Unity, Max Msp","2m x 2m","A series of sleep scans performed in one night, over the space of 9 hours, at the height of uncertainty in a decade-long immigration process.\n\n7.7 million Venezuelans are currently scattered across the world in one of the largest humanitarian crisis of displacement. Many are currently awaiting decisions from their host countries. Light Sleeper is a topological portrait of the mind in limbo, an X-ray of unrest and a heat-map of exhaustion. The audience is invited to stretch and compress the sense of time of the Sleeper through the Metronome.\n\nIn March 2023, upon achieving legal status, the artist flew to Iceland to research the Venezuelan diaspora in what may well be one of the most extreme migration patterns in recent history. The soundscape is made of distorted fragments of interviews with journalists, Red Cross volunteers, refugees and near-by residents of a small Icelandic town called Laugarvatn (population 200) that, at the time, was housing around 100 Venezuelan refugees. Due to the fragility of their situation, no one wished to be on the record.\n\nLight Sleeper is a self portrait in motion exploring exhaustive states as a space for transformation. The terminal fatigue of all possibilities can often become a clearing of the stage that gives way for new creative modes to emerge, as in a Beckett play. Dedicated to asy-\nlum seekers, refugees and anyone else who has been caught in a fold between worlds, with their fate in the hands of faceless agents.",{"id":33,"title":34,"date":19,"artist":28,"medium":35,"dimensions":36,"description":37},"5","Still Moving: A Topological Study of Exhaustion","Wood, concrete, cardboard","150cm x 90cm","A cluster of sculptures, using different methods and materials interrogating how we talk about sleep: light, deep, heavy, broken, tight.

Byung-Chul Han (referencing Freud) considers the process of remembering, and forgetting, deeply human experiences and ways we make sense of the world. He contrasts this to the flattened time horizon of a big-data modelling process, where all reference points become collapsed into a “collective immanence”, and describes this as a perspective belonging to the undead.\n\nTwo chatbots (based on Llama 3.1 8B) have been fine-tuned on the artist’s recent writing. The bots are differentiated by their “system prompt” – precursor text that positions them in a space / time / situation, “Pastlife” is from Australia in the 90s, “Nathan” is situated in contemporary London.\n\nTheir different responses can be considered different masks made from the same mould, with similar shapes but infinite differences in the details.

The film merges moments of ‘ground truth’—incidental, day-to-day fragments of life in London, captured on an iPhone with a film-generating system that combines custom text and visual models. These machine learning systems intricately weave the visuals of ground truth with extracts from a family archive, penned by the artist’s mother.\n\nThe film emerges as a fictional connective tissue, threading together various pasts and perspectives from the artist’s family history. These interwoven narratives, told in the first person, traverse time, generations, and space, connecting disparate fragments of meaning.

The artist has created datasets – one based on time-lapse footage of news websites throughout the week of the 2020 election and the second created from on the ground footage shot by Kent Nishimura of the Los Angeles Times. These datasets are analysed using AI into three dimensional bodies, which are deconstructed step by step - a process revealing the inherent “infovasculature” of these moments.",{"id":79,"title":80,"date":19,"artist":20,"medium":81,"dimensions":82,"description":83},"13","Dreamspace (film) ","3 channel video","6 mins","In Dreamspace, we journey through an intricate map of the collective unconscious, crafted from over one hundred thousand dream journal entries transformed through advanced computational algorithms.
