## Artworks

### 1. Prism (February 2024) - Nathan Bayliss

Generative AI Film, 9 min 14 sec

### 2. Prism 2.0 (October 2024) - Nathan Bayliss

Generative AI Film, 8 min 17 sec

Prism is a collection of AI generated audio / visual fragments
created using text-based generative AI models responding to a
series of minimalist prompts that appear before each chapter.
Typically, when using text based generative AI, prompting is con-
sidered an art form in itself, with the specific sequence of words
constructing exactly what the artist intends. This work reverses
this dynamic, with ambiguous prompts open to a wide range of
interpretation.

The AI model provides a non-human perspective on human data
and experience – a diffracted view, like a prism that splits light
into reconfigurations. This diffracted view reveals the content, sub-
jectivity and bias inherent in the creation of the specific text and
audio models.

Prism 2.0 was created six months after the first film, and serves
as a document of the acceleration of this technology’s develop-
ment. The intention is to continue making updates to this film as
a homage to the Up series of documentaries directed by Michael
Apted and Paul Almond, but in this case document the changing
“face” of AI.

### 3. Untitled Mobile (2024) - Julian Bramley Burgess

Acrylic (60cm x 110cm)

The piece reflects exploration of kinetic and constructive art, cele-
brating the elegance of structure in motion and echoing construc-
tivist ideals of spatial presence and balance.

### 4. Light Sleeper (2023) - Owen Planchart

(2m x 2m)<br>
Bed, metronome, Esp32 micro-controller, microphone, Unity, Max
Msp

A series of sleep scans performed in one night, over the space of
9 hours, at the height of uncertainty in a decade-long immigration
process.

7.7 million Venezuelans are currently scattered across the world
in one of the largest humanitarian crisis of displacement. Many
are currently awaiting decisions from their host countries. Light
Sleeper is a topological portrait of the mind in limbo, an X-ray of
unrest and a heat-map of exhaustion. The audience is invited to
stretch and compress the sense of time of the Sleeper through
the Metronome.

In March 2023, upon achieving legal status, the artist flew to
Iceland to research the Venezuelan diaspora in what may well be
one of the most extreme migration patterns in recent history. The
soundscape is made of distorted fragments of interviews with

journalists, Red Cross volunteers, refugees and near-by residents
of a small Icelandic town called Laugarvatn (population 200) that, at
the time, was housing around 100 Venezuelan refugees. Due to the
fragility of their situation, no one wished to be on the record.

Light Sleeper is a self portrait in motion exploring exhaustive states
as a space for transformation. The terminal fatigue of all possibilities
can often become a clearing of the stage that gives way for new
creative modes to emerge, as in a Beckett play. Dedicated to asy-
lum seekers, refugees and anyone else who has been caught in a
fold between worlds, with their fate in the hands of faceless agents.

### 5. Still Moving: A Topological Study of Exhaustion (2024) Owen Planchart

(150cm x 90cm)<br>
Wood, concrete, cardboard

A cluster of sculptures, using different methods and materials inter-
rogating how we talk about sleep: light, deep, heavy, broken, tight.
Some are an amalgamation of multiple sleep scans that forsake the
human figure in favour of a topological terrain, others are individual
scans that represent the passage of one hour of physical [un]rest.

### 6. Rapture (2022) - Nathan Bayliss

23cm x 31cm framed<br>
Oil, Canvas Board

### 7. Useless Device (2023) - Rafa Roeder

Arduinos, Raspberry Pi, HDMI displays and I2c displays, Acrylic

Drawing on Sara Ahmed’s “What’s the Use?”, this Useless Device
responds to a question often-asked in relation to technology: ‘How
do I use it?’ By framing it as ‘useless,’ the installation imagines a
version of technology freed from its responsibility to serve capitalist
development.

### 8. Dreamspace (2020) - Julian Bramley Burgess

60x60cm framed

Mechanical plotter drawings

### 9. To remember, to forget (2024) - Nathan Bayliss

Wax, Raspberry Pi, Python, Custom LLM, Kinect Scans

“To Remember, to Forget” is a multi-modal self portrait blending
the material process of creating casts from a single mould with
the digital process of creating two AI characters based on the
same corpus of data. Byung-Chul Han (referencing Freud) con-
siders the process of remembering, and forgetting, deeply human
experiences and ways we make sense of the world. He contrasts
this to the flattened time horizon of a big-data modelling process,
where all reference points become collapsed into a “collective
immanence”, and describes this as a perspective belonging to
the undead.

Two chatbots (based on Llama 3.1 8B) have been fine-tuned
on the artist’s recent writing. The bots are differentiated by their
“system prompt” – precursor text that positions them in a space /
time / situation, “Pastlife” is from Australia in the 90s, “Nathan” is
situated in contemporary London.

Their different responses can be considered different masks
made from the same mould, with similar shapes but infinite dif-
ferences in the details. The emergent conversation constitutes a
recursive mode of self-reflection and a hallucinatory, speculative
self-portrait.

### 10. Lockdown\_ (2020) - Nathan Bayliss

3D photogrammetry, Unity, Kinect, Analog TV

Lockdown AR explores the tensions experienced through lock-
down within the setting of the artist’s own domestic environment.
The work constructs a “living archive” through digital forensic
techniques, creating a collection of interpolated moments,
engaged with through the AR portal. The viewer is cast as “time”
with their motion being translated to the time of the scene shown.
Inspired by the work of Karen Barad, the methodologies and
practice of Forensic Architecture and the cinematography of Al-
fred Hitchcock, the work serves as an archive of a unique, liminal
moment.

### 11. Corpus (2024) - Nathan Bayliss

Self-generating AI Film, variable duration

Custom text (Llama) and visual (SD-Turbo) models,
Touchdesigner Family Archival Text, Found Footage Fragments
Machine learning systems are anchored in the Corpus—the foun-
dational body of data from which patterns, shapes, trajectories,
and topologies are extrapolated.

Corpus is an automated biographical generative film that per-
petually writes and rewrites one-minute narratives, drawing from
archival sources that map the artist’s life. The film merges mo-
ments of ‘ground truth’—incidental, day-to-day fragments of life
in London, captured on an iPhone with a film-generating system
that combines custom text and visual models. These machine
learning systems intricately weave the visuals of ground truth with
extracts from a family archive, penned by the artist’s mother.

The film emerges as a fictional connective tissue, threading to-
gether various pasts and perspectives from the artist’s family his-
tory. These interwoven narratives, told in the first person, traverse
time, generations, and space, connecting disparate fragments of
meaning. They unlock a new ‘witnessing’ of past events, offer-
ing new perspectives on family history and offer a new porosity
between past and future.

### 12. Infovasculature of the Body Politic (2022) - Nathan Bayliss

2 Channel HD Film, 7 min

Infovasculature of the Body Politic is a film which considers the
online media coverage of the US election as an organism, and
investigates the pathology of this organism through a machine
learning and medical imaging examination. The US election loomed
throughout 2020 as a spectre on the global horizon – the tentacular
reach of these political events, through various media channels
started to assume a presence within everyday consciousness.
The artist has created datasets – one based on time-lapse footage
of news websites throughout the week of the 2020 election and the
second created from on the ground footage shot by Kent Nishimura
of the Los Angeles Times. These datasets are analysed using AI
into three dimensional bodies, which are deconstructed step by
step - a process revealing the inherent “infovasculature” of these
moments.

### 13. Dreamspace (film) (2024) - Julian Bramley Burgess

3 channel video, 5 min generative segments

In Dreamspace, we journey through an intricate map of the
collective unconscious, crafted from over one hundred thousand
dream journal entries transformed through advanced computational
algorithms. Words become stars, and their meanings intertwine
to form constellations, offering viewers a glimpse into humanity’s
shared dreamscapes. This immersive visualization, inspired by Carl
Jung’s archetypal psychology and Joseph Cornell’s celestial maps,
explores the boundaries of individual consciousness and our con-
nection to universal themes. Through this dynamic, luminous atlas,
Dreamspace invites us to reconsider the dream world as a shared
mental landscape—a place where our thoughts converge, unbound
by the waking mind’s constraints.

### 14. For Whom The Bells Toll (2023) - Owen Planchart

5m x 4m x 4m<br>
Genelec Speakers, Chains

For Whom The Bells Toll is an interactive, sound-sculpture, shown
as a series of scheduled experiments aimed to challenge the
roles of performer, instrument and choreographer by stuttering the
relationship between the acoustic and the spatial. Conceived as a
“jazz-object” that allows for infinite improvisations within mechan-
ically determined textures, the piece swings between a carefully
staged cacophony, and an unsupervised choreography of a phono-
phagic parasite that eats soundscapes.

### 15. QR Code Clock (2016) - Julian Bramley Burgess

10cm x 10cm<br>
Raspberry PI, HTML, JavaScript

QR clock subverts our modern obsession with time and technolo-
gy. A deliberately “useless” object, this piece presents time in the
most indirect way possible: as an animated QR code, readable only
by a scanning device. This layered mediation transforms a simple
glance into a ritual of decoding, highlighting our dependence on
technology to access even the most basic information. Through its
absurd functionality, QR Clock questions the utility-driven narratives
of contemporary devices, inviting us to pause and reflect on the
sometimes unnecessary complexity we impose on simple acts, like
knowing the time.
